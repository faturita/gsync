function [idx, tri] = nearestneighbour(varargin)
%NEARESTNEIGHBOUR    find nearest neighbours
%   IDX = NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(X) finds the nearest neighbour by Euclidean
%   distance to each point (column) in X from X. X is a matrix with points
%   as columns. IDX is a vector of indices into X, such that X(:, IDX) are
%   the nearest neighbours to X. e.g. the nearest neighbour to X(:, 2) is
%   X(:, IDX(2))
%
%   IDX = NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(P, X) finds the nearest neighbour by Euclidean
%   distance to each point in P from X. P and X are both matrices with the
%   same number of rows, and points are the columns of the matrices. Output
%   is a vector of indices into X such that X(:, IDX) are the nearest
%   neighbours to P
%
%   IDX = NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(I, X) where I is a logical vector or vector of
%   indices, and X has at least two rows, finds the nearest neighbour in X
%   to each of the points X(:, I).
%   I must be a row vector to distinguish it from a single point.
%   If X has only one row, the first input is treated as a set of 1D points
%   rather than a vector of indices
%
%   IDX = NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(..., Property, Value)
%   Calls NEARESTNEIGHBOUR with the indicated parameters set. Property
%   names can be supplied as just the first letters of the property name if
%   this is unambiguous, e.g. NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(..., 'num', 5) is equivalent
%   to NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(..., 'NumberOfNeighbours', 5). Properties are case
%   insensitive, and are as follows:
%      Property:                         Value:
%      ---------                         ------
%         NumberOfNeighbours             natural number, default 1
%            NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(..., 'NumberOfNeighbours', K) finds the closest
%            K points in ascending order to each point, rather than the
%            closest point. If Radius is specified and there are not
%            sufficient numbers, fewer than K neighbours may be returned
%
%         Radius                         positive, default +inf
%            NEARESTNEIGHBOUR(..., 'Radius', R) finds neighbours within
%            radius R. If NumberOfNeighbours is not set, it will find all
%            neighbours within R, otherwise it will find at most
%            NumberOfNeighbours. The IDX matrix is padded with zeros if not
%            all points have the same number of neighbours returned. Note
%            that specifying a radius means that the Delaunay method will
%            not be used.
%
%         DelaunayMode                   {'on', 'off', |'auto'|}
%            DelaunayMode being set to 'on' means NEARESTNEIGHBOUR uses the
%            a Delaunay triangulation with dsearchn to find the points, if
%            possible. Setting it to 'auto' means NEARESTNEIGHBOUR decides
%            whether to use the triangulation, based on efficiency. Note
%            that the Delaunay triangulation will not be used if a radius
%            is specified.
%
%         Triangulation                  Valid triangulation produced by
%                                        delaunay or delaunayn
%            If a triangulation is supplied, NEARESTNEIGHBOUR will attempt
%            to use it (in conjunction with dsearchn) to find the
%            neighbours.
%
%   [IDX, TRI] = NEARESTNEIGHBOUR( ... )
%   If the Delaunay Triangulation is used, TRI is the triangulation of X'.
%   Otherwise, TRI is an empty matrix
%
%   Example:
%
%     % Find the nearest neighbour in X to each column of X
%     x = rand(2, 10);
%     idx = nearestneighbour(x);
%
%     % Find the nearest neighbours to each point in p
%     p = rand(2, 5);
%     x = rand(2, 20);
%     idx = nearestneighbour(p, x)
%
%     % Find the five nearest neighbours to points x(:, [1 6 20]) in x
%     x = rand(4, 1000)
%     idx = nearestneighbour([1 6 20], x, 'NumberOfNeighbours', 5)
%
%     % Find all neighbours within radius of 0.1 of the points in p
%     p = rand(2, 10);
%     x = rand(2, 100);
%     idx = nearestneighbour(p, x, 'r', 0.1)
%
%     % Find at most 10 nearest neighbours to point p from x within a
%     % radius of 0.2
%     p = rand(1, 2);
%     x = rand(2, 30);
%     idx = nearestneighbour(p, x, 'n', 10, 'r', 0.2)
